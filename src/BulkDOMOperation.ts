 * Represents a complex DOM operation which can be done in smaller steps and
 * interleaved with other operations to optimize DOM usage and avoid thrashing.
 * 
 * The idea is that multiple BulkDOMOperation objects can be collected and
 * then the execution of each operation can be interleaved with the others.
 * This is done by first calling `runStep` once on each operation in the group
 * and then calling `runStep` again for all, and again until all of them
 * return true. Then the `finish` functions must be called for all.
 * 
 * Note that these functions are both optional and thus may be missing.
