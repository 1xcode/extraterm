/**
 * A "screen" or grid of cells.
 *
 * Note that the mapping from code units in a JavaScript style UTF-16 string
 * to and from cells in a grid is complex.
 *
 * A single character / Unicode code point, can require 0, 1 or 2 cells.
 * Many Asian languages and characters are "full width" and occupy 2 cells.
 * Emojis often occupy 2 cells as well.
 *
 * There are also complications on the encoding side too. Unicode code points
 * are 32 bit values, but the code units in a JavaScript string are encoded
 * using UTF-16, and hold 16 bit values. Code points outside the 16 bit range
 * use 2 code units with the "surrogate pairs" system. In this case 2 UTF-16
 * code units can map to just one cell in the grid.
 *
 * For the most part you can ignore the difference between cells and values in
 * JavaScript's UTF-16 based strings. The methods which deal with strings and
 * indexes assume UTF-16 indexes unless noted otherwise.
