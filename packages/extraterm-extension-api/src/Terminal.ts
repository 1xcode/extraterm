/**
 * An active terminal with connected TTY.
 *
 * A Terminal is the contents of a typical terminal tab. From a terminal
 * emulation point of view the terminal consists of a `screen` which is the
 * area where terminal applications can render output to, and a scrollback
 * area where rows of text which have "scrolled off" the top of the screen
 * are kept.
 *
 * Extraterm's model for the contents of the terminal is slightly more complex
 * than traditional terminal emulators. The contents of a terminal in Extraterm
 * is a stack of "blocks" of content which can be a mix of framed terminal
 * output and "viewers" holding different data like images and downloads. The
 * `blocks` property exposes this stack. New terminal output from applications
 * appears the last terminal output block. A terminal output block contains a
 * bunch of rows in its `scrollback` property. When a terminal output block is
 * the target of emulation, the contents of the `screen` visually appear as
 * part of this block.
 *
 * In the common case where no shell integration is being used, there will be
 * just one terminal output block, much like a traditional terminal emulator.
