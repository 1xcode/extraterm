This is just [lit-html](https://lit-html.polymer-project.org/) cross compiled to ES5 so that we can easily use it in Extraterm without having to go full ES6 modules for dependencies.

Once Extraterm is on a platform (Electron/node) which directly supports loading ES6 modules, then this package can probably be removed.
