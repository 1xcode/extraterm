About
-----
Extraterm is an open source project to build a better modern terminal emulator but it is also a platform for experimentation with more radical features around command line based computer interaction.

The primary developer is [Simon Edwards](mailto:simon@simonzone.com).


Status
------
:warning: Extraterm is very much in development and not suitable for production use. Use at your own risk. :warning:

With that out the way, the primary author does use it as their main terminal emulator. The basics are in place and it will run most common terminal applications such as vi, emacs and joe and even more demanding applications such as midnight commander. 

Current features:

* Supports Linux, Mac OS X and Cygwin on Windows
* xterm compatible
* Multiple tabs/terminals
* Keyboard based selection
* (Basic) vertical split
* Show images
* Shell integration; can isolate and 'frame' command output
* Previous command output can be used as input for new commands
* Command output is editable in place
* [MIT license](LICENSE.txt)
