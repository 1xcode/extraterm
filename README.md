About
-----
Extraterm is an open source project to build a better and modern terminal emulator, and also to experiment with more radical features to enhance the command line. More background information is in the [Why document](why.md).

The primary developer is [Simon Edwards](mailto:simon@simonzone.com).


Status
------
:warning: Extraterm is very much in development and not suitable for production use. Use at your own risk. :warning:

With that out of the way, the primary author does use it as their main terminal emulator on a daily basis. The basics are in place and it will run most common terminal applications such as vi, emacs and joe without problems and even more demanding applications such as midnight commander.

Current features:

* Supports Linux, Mac OS X and Cygwin on Windows
* xterm compatible
* Multiple tabs/terminals
* Keyboard based selection
* (Basic) vertical split
* Show images in the terminal
* Shell integration; can isolate and 'frame' command output
* Previous command output can be used as input for new commands
* Command output is editable in place
* [MIT license](LICENSE.txt)
* ...much more to come
