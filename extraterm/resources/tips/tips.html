  <h2><i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Tip: Shell Integration</h2>
  <p>
    Extraterm's shell integration unlocks many powerful features such as frames around command output, reusing command
    output and in-place editing of text. bash, zsh and fish shells are supported. To enable it in your shell session see
    <a href="https://github.com/sedwards2009/extraterm/blob/master/docs/guide.md#shell-integration">this guide</a>.

  <h2><i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Tip: Command Palette</h2>
  <p>Extraterm has a pop up Command Palette <span class="CLASS_KEYCAP" data-command="extraterm:application.openCommandPalette"></span>
    where all relevant commands can be seen, searched and executed.

  <h2><i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Tip: Tabs</h2>
  <p>Use tabs to run multiple terminal sessions at the same time. Create a new tab by clicking on the plus button in the top
    right or by using <span class="CLASS_KEYCAP" data-command="extraterm:window.newTerminal"></span> on the keyboard.
  </p>
  <p>
    Move between tabs using next <span class="CLASS_KEYCAP" data-command="extraterm:window.focusTabRight"></span> and
    previous <span class="CLASS_KEYCAP" data-command="extraterm:window.focusTabLeft"></span> keys.

  <h2><i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Tip: Frames</h2>
  <p>
    Once <a href="https://github.com/sedwards2009/extraterm/blob/master/docs/guide.md#shell-integration">the shell
    integration</a> has been set up, Extraterm will place 'frames' around the output of commands. Frames also display
    the command which was executed and warn when a command has indicated failure status. Frames can also be deleted
    from the scrollback if desired (<i class='fa fa-times-circle'></i>
    <span class="CLASS_KEYCAP" data-command="extraterm:terminal.deleteLastFrame"></span>) or moved
    into their own tab for safe keeping (<i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i>
    <span class="CLASS_KEYCAP" data-command="extraterm:terminal.openLastFrame"></span>), plus many
    other things.

  <h2><i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Tip: Cursor Mode</h2>
  <p>
    Extraterm has two modes: <em>normal mode</em> which acts as a traditional terminal emulator, and
    <em>cursor mode</em> which allows you to navigate the screen and the contents of the scrollback using a cursor
    like in a text editor.
  </p>
  <p>
    Enter cursor mode using <span class="CLASS_KEYCAP" data-command="extraterm:terminal.enterCursorMode"></span>.
    Once in cursor mode you have a blinking vertical bar cursor and keypresses are no longer sent to your shell. The
    cursor keys works like a text editor and text can be selected using shift and copied to the clipboard  
    <span class="CLASS_KEYCAP" data-command="extraterm:terminal.copyToClipboard"></span>. Text
    inside frames can also be edited in-place. Useful when you want to use previous command output to prepare your next
    command line.
  </p>
  <p>
    Exit cursor mode using <span class="CLASS_KEYCAP" data-command="extraterm:terminal.enterNormalMode"></span>.
  </p>
  <p>

  <h2><i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Tip: Multiple cursor editing in cursor mode</h2>
  <p>
    Extraterm has some text editor features, and like many modern text editors it too support mutliple cursor editing.
  </p>
  <p>
    When in cursor mode press <span class="CLASS_KEYCAP" data-command="extraterm:textEditor.cursorColumn"></span>
    or the Command Palette <span class="CLASS_KEYCAP" data-command="extraterm:application.openCommandPalette"></span>
    ("Selection to Multiple Cursors") to create a column of cursors. Press Escape to return to one cursor.
  </p>
  <p>
    To create fewer cursors, first select the rows where you want the cursors to appear before executing the multiple
    cursor command.

  <h2><i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Tip: Use cursor mode and frames to prepare complex
    commands</h2>
  <p>
    Use <a href="https://github.com/sedwards2009/extraterm/blob/master/docs/guide.md#cursor-mode">cursor mode</a> and
    <a href="https://github.com/sedwards2009/extraterm/blob/master/docs/guide.md#shell-integration">frames</a> to edit
    text already on the screen to prepare a complex command.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once your command is complete the next question is how to get the shell to execute it. One way is to select it and
    copy it to the clipboard <span class="CLASS_KEYCAP" data-command="extraterm:terminal.copyToClipboard"></span>, exit cursor mode and then paste <span class="CLASS_KEYCAP"
    data-command="pasteFromClipboard"></span> it into the shell.
  </p>
  <p>
    Another, faster way is to select the text and one of these commands:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>"type selection" command <span class="CLASS_KEYCAP"
    data-command="extraterm:terminal.typeSelection"></span> which types the selected text into the shell.</li>
    <li>"type selection and hit enter" command <span class="CLASS_KEYCAP"
    data-command="extraterm:terminal.typeSelectionAndCr"></span> does the same thing as above but also executes the command.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2><i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Tip: Use text from a frame in a command pipe-line</h2>
  <p>
    Once <a href="https://github.com/sedwards2009/extraterm/blob/master/docs/guide.md#shell-integration">shell
    integration</a> is set up, Extraterm will place frames around the output of commands. Each frame has a little tag
    <i class='fa fa-tag'></i> with a number which indentifies the frame. Extraterm's <code>from</code> command lets you
    grab the contents of a frame and use it as part of a shell command.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, if we have run the <code>ls</code> command and it has tag <i class='fa fa-tag'></i>5 then we can
    use <code>from</code> and the normal <code>grep</code> command to filter the output.
  </p>
  <samp>
    from 5 | grep .txt
  </samp>
  <p>
    This will find any lines with the text ".txt" in it. This works across tabs and terminal sessions.

  <h2><i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Tip: Use the "Go to Previous/Next Frame" commands to quickly move
  through the scrollback</h2>
  <p>
    Use the "Go to Previous Frame" <span class="CLASS_KEYCAP" data-command="extraterm:terminal.goToPreviousFrame"></span> and "Go to Next Frame" <span class="CLASS_KEYCAP"
    data-command="extraterm:terminal.goToNextFrame"></span> commands to quickly navigate between frames in
    the scrollback. This is useful when you are at the bottom of a tower of output and you want to get to the top.

  <h2><i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Tip: Splitting the window</h2>
  <p>
    The "Horizontal Split" <span class="CLASS_KEYCAP" data-command="extraterm:window.horizontalSplit"></span>
    and "Vertical Split" <span class="CLASS_KEYCAP" data-command="extraterm:window.verticalSplit"></span>
    commands let you split the window in half with side-by-side groups of tabs. These too can be split again if
    desired.
  </p>
  <p>
    These commands are all available in the Command Palette <span class="CLASS_KEYCAP" data-command="extraterm:application.openCommandPalette"></span>.

  <h2><i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Tip: Drag and Drop tabs and command frames</h2>
  <p>
    Tabs can dragged around and repositioned using the mouse. Command frames can also be dragged out of the terminal and up to the tab bar. Command frames which hold text can also be dragged outside of Extraterm and dropped into any application which accepts text via drag and drop.
