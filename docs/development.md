Development
===========

First: One Simple Rule
----------------------
A simple ground rule: Extraterm is intended to be an open source *project*, and not just open source *code*. This means that all contributors need to be able get along together and cooperate on a basic level in a productive and civil way.


Technology
----------
Extraterm is build on the following technologies:

* [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) - A platform for running desktop applications made using web technologies.
* [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org) - superset of JavaScript which adds static typing.
* [CodeMirror](http://electron.atom.io/) - text editor component which is used extensively to show terminal output and provide cursor based selections and editing.
* [term.js](https://github.com/chjj/term.js) - Terminal emulator component, pulled into the Extraterm code base and heavily modified.
* [pty.js](https://github.com/chjj/pty.js) - PTY support for node.js.
* â€¦ plus many other smaller libraries.

Thanks go out to the people and organisations responsible for the great software and tools I've been able to build on.


Running from Source
-------------------
Getting started from source:

* Clone the repository from github to your local machine.
* Make sure that you are using node version 5.1.1. :warning: This is important. Using the same node version as the version of Electron simplifies installation of the one native node module that Extraterm depends on (pty.js). You can fetch it from https://nodejs.org/dist/v5.1.1/
* Install the modules: `npm install` (pty.js will not install on cygwin, but that is ok and expected.)
* Build it: `npm run build`
* Run it: `npm run run`

If you are using Atom as your editor, then it will quickly and automatically compile the TS files for you. You can usually skip the manual build step during most development.


Submitting Changes
------------------
* Bugs and features requests go in the github issue tracker.
* Use Pull Requests to submit changes.
* Discuss large changes via an issue in the tracker before hand.

Regular good contributors will be given direct access to the repo. I want to get the bus factor for this project above 1.


Code Formatting
---------------
The basic rule is just follow the formatting already being used in existing code. Sorry, it is not as consistent as it should be.

* Indents are 2 spaces.
* semi-colons are required.
* Use exact comparisons, `===` and `!==`.
* Prefer `null` over `undefined`.
* Be explicit about showing what the code means. No cute shortcuts.
