This release introduces a new default user interface theme called "Two Dark". It is a port and tweak of the "One Dark" theme from the [Atom text editor](https://atom.io/). It is a modern and minimal theme and just like in Atom, it also automatically adapts to the selected terminal color theme. Matching terminal and syntax color themes have also been added. The previous two UI themes are still available.

Other new features:

* Compact window title bar style option for all UI themes.
* Configurable padding/margin for the terminal window and around frames.

This release also contains significant "behind the scenes" work to simplify the CSS and styling used for the UI.
