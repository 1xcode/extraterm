Note: If you have made customised keybindings then you will have to delete it, duplicate and recreate it. Sorry.

Feature:

* Find in scrollback. [issue #68](https://github.com/sedwards2009/extraterm/issues/68)

Bug fixes:

* Correctly show/hide window controls depending on the settings. [issue #159](https://github.com/sedwards2009/extraterm/issues/159)
* Fix the open folder buttons in the Appearance settings tab. [issue #151](https://github.com/sedwards2009/extraterm/issues/151)

This release contains a lot of internal infrastructure work around 'commands' and keybindings and also refactoring regarding how the application is rendered. This work provides a foundation for a future extension API and also faster development.
