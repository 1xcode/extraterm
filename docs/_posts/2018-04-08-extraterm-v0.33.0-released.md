UI related improvements and some bug fixes.

* Organised the Settings tab and gave it a menu on the left side.
* Moved the key bindings settings into the Settings tab proper.
* Upgraded the icons to Font Awesome Free 5.0.9.
* Removed all UI themes except for the two good ones, Atomic Light/Dark.
* Tweaked the `clear` command fix to have less unexpected side-effects.
* [Fixed bug #83](https://github.com/sedwards2009/extraterm/issues/83) related to native window bars causing a corrupt UI.
