This release is centered around integrating the [Qt-Advanced-Docking-System](https://github.com/githubuser0xFFFF/Qt-Advanced-Docking-System#grouped-dragging). This adds a huge amount of flexibility regarding how tabs work. Now you can drag tabs in and out of their window and between windows. Tabs can also be dragging side-by-side into separate "split" panes of groups of tabs.

Commands still need to be added to the Command Palette for tasks such as splitting a tab off into its own pane, and improved keyboard navigation between split tabs.


**Features**

* Tabs can be dragging in and out of windows.
* Tabs can be arranged into "split panes" side-by-side.
* A "tab menu" dropdown is available in the top right corner of each group of tabs.

**Bug Fixes**

* "Clean Scrollback" command works again and doesn't crash.
