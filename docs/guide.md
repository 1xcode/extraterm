User Interface
==============

Menu
----
In the top right corner of the window is the application menu with the "stacked bars" icon.


Terminal Tabs
-------------
Terminals are shown inside tabs. New tabs can be created by clicking on the + (plus) icon at the top.

The "Split" option on the application menu can be selected to split the window into to two groups of side-by-side tabs.


Short cuts:

* Use Shift+Left and Shift+Right to move between tabs.
* Ctrl+T opens a new tab.
* Ctrl+Tab to switch between panes.
* Ctrl+S Split/unsplit the view into 2 side-by-side panes.

Tip: Turning off split view is a fast way of giving a terminal tab more space. When you split the view again, Extraterm will remember and restore the previous configuration.


Frames & Viewers
----------------
Frames group data and text. They come in different various kinds depending on
the data.

Use to Ctrl+Space to focus frame. Once a command frame is focused,
use cursor up/down to move between frames. Use the escape key to exit this
mode, or just start typing to continue sending keys to the currently running
command or shell.



Command Frames
--------------
Command frames hold the output of command given on the command line. In the
top left of a command frame is an icon indicating the status of the command
execution. A good checkmark indicates that the command complete successfully
and return a 0 status code. Any other status code is indicated by a red cross
icon and usually indicates an error.

Frames can be prevented for certain commands by adding a list of regular
expressions to the "noFrameCommands" property in the configuration file.
Each regular expression is matched against the command line. If one matches,
then the frame is not shown.
